# NTU_CVSD_1141

## Overview

This is a repository for the "Computer-Aided VLSI System Design" (CVSD) course (114-1 Semester). The aim of this project is to provide code, data, and resources associated with the course assignments and the final project.

## Contents

* **HW1 ~ HW5**: These directories contain the source code and reports for the individual assignments completed during the semester. Key topics include Verilog implementation, EDA tool usage (Design Compiler, Innovus), and optimization techniques.
* **Final Project**: Class competition project **BCH Decoder**.
    * **Description**: The design is based on the paper *"Area-Optimized Fully-Flexible BCH Decoder for Multiple GF Dimensions"*. It features **8-parallel syndrome calculation/chien search units** and a **SiBM-based polynomial generation unit**.
    * **Performance**: Achieved **5th place** in the energy metrics.
